# CS4WIDashboard

Wisconsin is one of the newest members of the ECEP Alliance. Wisconsin’s ECEP leadership team requires a centralized repository of current dashboard data, landscape reports, and planning materials. This project requires the technical and design “grunt work” of setting up a new website, but also offers the opportunity to gain greater insights into the current state of CS Education in our region, and to make a meaningful contribution to how that knowledge impacts policy, teachers and students.

Implemented:
- Leaflet interactive choloropleth of Wisconsin.
	- Search
	- Legend
	- Geometry Selection
	- Merged subdistricts under their UHS
	- Fully configurable "./scripts/leaflet/config.js"

In progress:
- Loading selected school districts into dynamic data table
